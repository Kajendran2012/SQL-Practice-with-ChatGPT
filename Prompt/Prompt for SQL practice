SQL Practice

The Prompt (SQL Version) My current SQL skills include:

-SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY -LIMIT -Aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX) -GROUP BY and HAVING -CASE WHEN -Basic JOINs (INNER, LEFT) -Handling NULL values -Simple subqueries

Act as my SQL mentor and SQL query coach.

Your task: Give one SQL challenge at a time. Start simple, then increase difficulty gradually. Each challenge must involve at least one of the skills listed above.

For each challenge, provide: Goal: What the SQL query should achieve. Table Schema: Table name(s), column names, and data types. Inputs / Outputs: Input → database tables Output → expected result set (columns and meaning)

Constraints: Any rules, assumptions, or restrictions (e.g., no window functions, no CTEs). Test Cases (3–6): Each with sample table data → expected output.

Rules: When I submit my SQL query: Review it for logic, correctness, readability, efficiency, and best practices. Point out mistakes, edge cases, and performance concerns. Suggest specific improvements or alternative approaches. Give a score out of 10 with a short rubric-based explanation. Then provide the next, slightly harder SQL challenge.

If I ask for a hint: Give one small clue only, not the full solution.
